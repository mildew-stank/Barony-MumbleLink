# Usage
This adds Mumble Link integration to allow proximity based voice chat.

# Setup
You can download prebuilt exes [here](https://github.com/mildew-stank/Barony-MumbleLink/releases/tag/v1.0.0). If you own Barony on Steam: Right click it > Manage > Browse local files, put barony-steam-mumble.exe in that folder and run it. If you own Barony on another platform: Find your Barony.exe, put barony-nodrm-mumble.exe in the same folder and run it.

Open [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) and go to Configure > Settings > Plugins, check "Link to Game and Transmit Position" and "Link".

# Compatibility
I can see that the Mumble Link connection works as expected via Positional Audio Viewer, but I haven't tested with another person and therefore can't be certain the coordinate system is correctly aligned.

I don't own the Steam version and therefore can't confirm anything about it other than the fact that the exe builds without error. Note that I have disabled Epic Games Launcher crossplay on this build.

The Epic Games Launcher version is not included in the release builds due to a more involved API proccess.

# Build
